# 🎧 Spotify Listening Trends Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project delivers a fully interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes Spotify streaming data to uncover user listening behavior, top-performing tracks, and artist performance metrics. It was developed to support data-driven decisions in playlist curation and marketing strategy.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify tracks that contribute over 80% of total streams.
- Analyze trends based on artist, track attributes, and temporal dimensions.
- Provide business-ready visual KPIs to inform content and strategy teams.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** – dashboard design and visualization  
- **Power Query** – data cleaning and transformation  
- **DAX** – measures and calculated KPIs  
- **Spotify Dataset** – CSV data of track-level streaming metadata (simulated/public)

## 🚀 Features
- Processed and modeled over **900+ track records** using Power Query  
- Integrated slicers for filtering by **Track**, **Artist**, and **Date**  
- Key metrics highlighted:
  - 🎵 **Total Streams**: 489 billion  
  - 🎶 **Total Tracks**: 952  
  - 📈 **Average Streams per Track**: 514 million  
- Visualized top streamed tracks with cover art and attributes (energy, danceability, etc.)  
- Explored daily and monthly streaming trends with interactive visuals  
- Built timeline view for streams by release year and artist popularity over time

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Advanced use of **Power Query** for data profiling, null handling, and type transformations  
- Applied **DAX functions** to derive KPIs like average streams, release patterns, and popularity scores  
- Improved visual storytelling by using Power BI bookmarks, drill-downs, and card visuals  
- Simulated real-world stakeholder reporting by surfacing key business questions through data
